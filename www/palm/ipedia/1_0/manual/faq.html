  <td>
	  iPedia uses articles from <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org">WikiPedia</a> 
		project. WikiPedia is a collaboratively edited encyclopedia. The project 
		started in 2001 and has been growing at an amazing pace. In only 3 years 
		WikiPedia grew to more than 300,000 articles (for comparison, 
		Encyclopedia Britannica claims to offer about
		<a href="http://www.britannica.com/premium/">120.000 articles</a>) and 
		the growth doesn't seem to be stopping. Just imagine how many articles
		we'll have 10 years from now!

<h2>Why iPedia article is different than corresponding WikiPedia article?</h2>
<table cellpadding="6" width="100%">
<tr>
  <td>
	There are two reasons why this might happen.<p>
	First, we use cached copy of WikiPedia articles. This copy is usually a few days old. Since
	WikiPedia is growing so quickly, an article might have been modified since the last time we cached it. But don't worry,
	we update our database every couple of days so you do get the latest and freshest content.
	</p>
	<p>Second, due to Palm OS limitations, we might not be able to display the 
	whole article. We're working on improving things,
   	but currently, for example, we don't display pictures, tables, some characters (e.g. Japanese).

<h2>Why iPedia article count is different than WikiPedia article count?</h2>
<table cellpadding="6" width="100%">
<tr>
  <td>
	There are two reasons why this might happen.<p>
	First, our content is a copy of WikiPedia data, usually a few days old.</p>
	<p>Second, counting articles is an inexact science and our algorithm might be 
	slightly different than the one used by WikiPedia.</p>
	<p>In any case, the difference is minimal.

<h2>Why there is an error in an article?</h2>
<table cellpadding="6" width="100%">
<tr>
  <td>
	  ArsLexis doesn't control the  content of articles. iPedia uses articles 
		from <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org">WikiPedia</a> 
		project. The great thing about WikiPedia is that anyone can contribute 
		to an article. Thanks to that, the greatest minds on the plan might 
		contribute to the project. The not-so-great think about WikiPedia is 
		that anyone can contribute to an article, even those less knowledgeable. 
		There are also cases of vandalism (usually quickly repaired). Due to 
		that fact some question the validity of WikiPedia as a source 
		information.
		<p>We believe that it's an extraordinary source of information, but 
		don't take our word for granted! Use iPedia (a risk-free proposition 
		since we provide trial version that allows limited number of lookups and 
		unlimited number of random article lookups) and find out for yourself if 
		the quality of articles is up to your standard.</p>
