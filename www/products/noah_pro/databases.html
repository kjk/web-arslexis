<H4> <a href="/">Home</a> &raquo; Databases for Noah Pro </h4>

<p>
<b>Noah Pro</b> can use a wealth of different dictionaries (and it's
possible to <a href="making_dictionaries.html">create your own
dictionaries</a>). <p>
There are two main types of dictionaries:
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Cafe/1131/bierce.html">
Devil's Dictionary</a>, a satirical dictionary by Ambrose Bierce
<li> dictionaries based on
<a href="http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/">WordNet</a> database.
</ul>

In order to accommodate needs of different users Noah Pro provides
many versions of WordNet database. Each database contains a different
set of words and takes a different amount of memory.
In short:
<ul>
<li> <b>mini</b> (wn_mini.pdb), <b>small</b> (wn_small.pdb), <b>medium</b>
(wn_medium.pdb) and <b>full</b> (wn_full.pdb) are databases of increasing
size. Each one contains more words than its predecessor but also requires
more memory.
<li> a definition in Noah consists of explanations and sample phrases. Some users
prefer to save memory and not to have sample phrases. For those users each database
comes in <b>lite</b> version without sample phrases (wn_mini_lite.pdb,
wn_small_lite.pdb, wn_medium_lite.pdb, wn_full_lite.pdb, wn_advanced_lite.pdb).
Lite version requires roughly 30% less memory.
<li> some users don't need definitions of simple words. They should find
<b>advanced</b> (wn_advanced.pdb) version of the database useful. 
</ul>

We recommend using the biggest database you can afford (in terms of memory
taken on your PalmPilot). Here's a detailed information on every available
databases: <p>
