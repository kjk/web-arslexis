<H4> <a href="/">Home</a> &raquo; Noah Pro Frequently Asked Questions </h4>

<h4> Q1. What's in a name? </h4>

<a href="http://www.britannica.com/bcom/eb/article/0/0,5716,78419+1+76399,00.html">
Noah Webster</a> was a famous lexicographer.

<h4> Q2. Program fails to install. </h4>

Some databases are quite big. Please check that you have enough free memory
on your PalmPilot. If there is not enough memory synchronization will fail.

<h4> Q3. I use Macintosh and I got garbage on the screen or program crashes. </h4>

A few Mac users reported that what they got on the screen
is garbage or the program crashes. This is most likely fault of the unpacker
program used to unzip noah_pro.zip.<p>
Some unzippers have settings to convert text files to Mac text files.
This alters the content of files and corrupts them.
This option can be set to "convert if file is recognized as text"
but unfortunately .prc and .pdb files are often (wrongly) recognized as text.
To fix that <b>change your unzipper program settings to "never convert text files".
</b> <p>
For ZipIt 1.4 the preference reads "by default, smart-strip linefeeds
from text files" and should be turned off. It may be different in
different programs.

<h4> Q4. I get "Database not found" error on startup</h4>

It means that only the reader program has been installed
(noah_pro.prc). Please also install a database (e.g., wn_medium.pdb)
on your device.

<h4> Q5. Does Noah support Springboard memory extension for Visor?</h4>

Yes, you can put Noah Pro on Visor's 8 MB flash module (but not the
backup module). Just move Noah Pro and a databases of your choice to
flash module using File Mover application.
<p>
<b>Important:</b> it is very important <b>not to move Noah Pref</b> to
flash module. If you do it Visor will crash with "Fatal
error.......dataMgr.c,Line:5304,DmWriteCheck" error when you start
Noah. To fix it just move Noah Pref back to regular memory.

<h4> Q6. Does Noah support TGRpro's compact flash?</h4>

Noah runs on TGRpro just fine but it doesn't know how to use it's compact
flash memory. It also may crash if it's placed on CF card and used
with AutoCF<p>
Ability to read databases directly from flash memory is one of the planned
future improvements for Noah.


<h4> Q7. The database is too big. </h4>

We want to provide the biggest and most comprehensive dictionary for PalmPilot.
Even though Noah Pro uses very efficient compression (more than 50%) the size
of the source material makes the resulting database big. But we also provide
a lot of smaller dictionaries. Read <a href="databases.html">database comparison
</a> to decide which database will best suit your needs.

<h4> Q8. How can I make my own database? </h4>

All is explained in
<a href="making_dictionaries.html">
this document</a>

<h4> Q9. I like Noah's icon. </h4>

Noah's icon has been made and kindly provided by 
<a href="http://www.ewtoo.org/~matt/">Matt Sephon</a>
(<a href="mailto:matt@ewtoo.org">matt@ewtoo.org</a>).

<h4> Q10. I have a question that is not answered here. </h4>

Don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:support@arslexis.com">ask us</a>.
