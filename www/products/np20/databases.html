<H4> <a href="/">Home</a> &raquo; <a href="manual.html"> Noah Pro manual </a>: Databases for Noah Pro 2.0 </h4>

<p>
<b>Noah Pro</b> comes with a wealth of different dictionaries (and it's
possible to <a href="../np20/making_dictionaries.html">create your own
dictionaries</a>). <p>

Databases are based on the same data but differ in the number of words they
contain and amount of memory they use.
<p>
For beginner users we recommend using <b>wn_medium.pdb</b> database that is being installed
by default (see <a href="manual.html">manual</a> for installation instructions) but
you can install other databases. In that case we recommend removing Noah Pro
and re-installing <b>noah_pro.prc</b> and the database of your choice.
<p>

The following databases are included in the main distribution file noah_pro2.zip:
<ul>
<li> <b>wn_medium.pdb</b> (has 37 thousand words and requires 1693 kB of internal memory),
<li> <b>wn_full.pdb</b> (has 122 thousand words and requires 4687 kB of internal memory)
  <li> <b>wn_ex_full.pdb</b> (database for using on external memory cards such 
    as Palm m105/m125/m500/m505/m515 SD/MMC card, Sony CLIE MemoryStick, MemPlug, 
    HandEra SD or CF card, TRGPro CF card; has 122 thousand words, requires 1 
    MB of internal memory and 5 MB of external memory). 
</ul>

<p>
You can download additional databases from
<a href="http://www.palmgear.com/software/showsoftware.cfm?prodID=7800">here</a>.
This file contains following databases: wn_advanced.pdb, wn_advanced_lite.pdb,
wn_full_lite.pdb, wn_medium_lite.pdb, wn_mini.pdb, wn_mini_lite.pdb,
wn_small.pdb, wn_small_lite.pdb and devil.pdb
(<a href="http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Cafe/1131/bierce.html">Devil's Dictionary</a>,
satirical dictionary by Ambrose Bierce).

<p>

We recommend using the biggest database you can afford (in terms of memory
taken on your PDA). Here's a detailed information on every available
databases: <p>

<table cellpadding=4 border=0 align=center>
<tr bgcolor="#aaaaaa">
 <td>Name</td>
 <td>Number of words</td>
 <td>Required memory</td>
 <td>Required memory for lite version</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>Devil's Dictionary</td>
  <td>900</td>
  <td>108 kB</td>
  <td> N/A </td>
</tr>


<tr>
  <td>mini</td>
  <td>13300</td>
  <td>980 kB</td>
  <td>681 kB</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>small</td>
  <td>18421</td>
  <td>1138 kB</td>
  <td>782 kB</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>medium</td>
  <td>37625</td>
  <td>1693 kB</td>
  <td>1195 kB</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>advanced</td>
  <td>90255</td>
  <td>2932 kB</td>
  <td>2672 kB</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>full</td>
  <td>122679</td>
  <td>4687 kB</td>
  <td>3937 kB</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>
As can be seen from the above table, each dictionary (mini, small, medium, advanced)
has a "lite" version with the same number of words but smaller in size.
Those databases are smaller because they don't have sample phrases (so
if you decide that sample phrases are not important for you, you can
save memory).
<p>
Full dictionary is a superset of medium (i.e., has all the words that medium
has and more) and advanced. Medium is a superset of small,
small is a superset of mini.
<p>
Advanced dictionary is different - it doesn't have definitions of simple
words (like "home" etc.). You might find memory savings useful if
you're a native speaker and don't need definitions of simple words.
