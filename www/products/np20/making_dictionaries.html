<h3> Introduction </h3>
<p>
<b>Noah Pro</b> can be thought of as a dictionary engine. It is possible
to create simple dictionaries that will be recognized by Noah Pro.
At present the workflow is as follows:
<ul>
<li> create a dictionary in an ascii text file. The dictionary file
must have a very strict format.
<li> send us the file or provide a download link
<li> we'll send you back *.pdb file with this dictionary that you'll be able
to use in Noah Pro
</ul>


<h3> Format of the dictionary file </h3>

Here's a sample from exemplary dictionary file (this is a real-life example
taken from Devil's Dictionary):

<pre>ABSCOND
v.i.
To "move in a mysterious way," commonly with the
property of another.

ABSENT
adj.
Peculiarly exposed to the tooth of detraction; vilified;
hopelessly in the wrong; superseded in the consideration and affection 
of another.

ABSENTEE
n.
A person with an income who has had the forethought to
remove himself from the sphere of exaction.
</pre>

As this self-explanatory example shows, for each entry in the dictionary we have:
<ul>
<li> headword
<li> part of speech of this headword
<li> definition
<li> empty line to separate from next entry
</ul>

As a part of speech you can use the following: <b>n.</b>, <b>adj.</b>,
<b>adv.</b>, <b>v.i.</b>, <b>v.t.</b>.
